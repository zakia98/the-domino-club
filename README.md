## Reflections

The main goal of the project was to employ the use of security and authentication. Using passportJS, I was able to employ a system which allowed users to sign up, and have their login details displayed across the app. 

Additionally, the project makes use of the express validator library to create custom validation and sanitization of user input for text message and signup forms.
